# rangular-api

This app uses ruby on rails as the backend with angular as the front end. In order to use the code you will need to set up rails app via rails-api gem instructions. I also created a counter part to render the api with my angular app, which is separate. The point of this was to make a decoupled api with a fron end framework so it would be easy to switch out apis without having to update any code.

Cheers!
